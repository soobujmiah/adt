# ADT — ARM64 Android Development Toolchain

**Android development on Linux ARM64 — prepare, build, sign, install, inspect, debug and validate Android applications without an x86_64-only Android Studio.**

ADT is a practical Android/Flutter toolchain for Linux ARM64 environments, including Termux + PRoot Debian on ARM64 Android devices. Google's Linux SDK host binaries are x86_64; ADT builds the native host tools from official AOSP source for aarch64/glibc, keeps offline-installable verified artifacts, and validates the whole pipeline on a real physical device.

The CLI toolchain is the canonical path. GUI/X11 support is optional.

## What is ADT?

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **What** | Native ARM64 Android SDK build-tools + platform-tools, built from AOSP source, plus the host toolchain around them (JDK, CMake, Ninja, NDK shims, Flutter/Dart support). |
| **Why** | An ARM64 machine — including an Android phone running Termux + PRoot Debian — should be able to produce, sign, install and validate real APKs, with no x86_64 host in the loop. |
| **Who for** | Developers working on ARM64 Linux (Android devices via Termux/PRoot, Asahi Linux, ARM64 servers/boards) who need a complete, honest Android toolchain. |
| **Installs** | `aapt`/`aapt2`/`aidl`/`zipalign`/`dexdump`/`split-select`, `adb`/`fastboot` + platform-tools, JDK-based `apksigner`/`d8`/R8/`sdkmanager`, NDK/CMake shims, Android platforms. |
| **Status** | End-to-end APK pipeline **verified on a real device** — see [Evidence](#evidence). |

## Quick start

On any aarch64 Linux with glibc (validated target: Termux + PRoot Debian on an ARM64 phone):

```bash
# One-liner: fetches the repo and runs the whole bootstrap unattended.
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soobujmiah/adt/main/install.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

From a clone, `./setup.sh` runs **guided** (checks the device first, asks before each step) and `./setup.sh bootstrap --auto` runs **unattended**. Both are idempotent — re-running updates an existing clone and skips what is already installed.

Verify afterwards:

```bash
./setup.sh doctor        # pinpoints the broken piece if anything misbehaves
```

Everyday commands for every installed tool — device pairing, the APK pipeline, signing, troubleshooting — live in **[COMMANDS.md](COMMANDS.md)**.

## What can it do?

1. **Build** — native ARM64 `aapt2`/`aidl` compile resources and AIDL; Gradle/Flutter produce APKs.
2. **Sign** — `apksigner` (JVM, Debian-packaged) signs and verifies APKs.
3. **Install** — native ARM64 `adb` installs onto a physical device over USB or wireless debugging.
4. **Inspect / debug** — `dexdump`, `adb logcat`, shell access, process checks.
5. **Validate** — confirm Android selects the `arm64-v8a` native library, the app launches and the process survives.

## Evidence — what is actually tested

The strongest test is the full path, not the presence of binaries. On the validation device below, this chain ran end-to-end:

> native source → ARM64 shared library → APK packaging → signing → ADB installation → ARM64 ABI selection → JNI loading → native execution → log output → process remains alive

| Canonical validation record | [`docs/REAL_DEVICE_BUILD_VALIDATION.md`](docs/REAL_DEVICE_BUILD_VALIDATION.md) — **VERIFIED / CLOSED** |

Every version's exact status, AOSP tag, CI run and notes are tracked in [`versions.json`](versions.json). Per-component history lives in [`docs/validation/`](docs/validation/). The evidence vocabulary used across this project and its ecosystem sites: **Verified · Measured · Observed · Experimental · Not yet tested · Not supported**.

## ADT and Ternux — two layers of one ARM64 story

         ADT                      Ternux

 Android development        Linux ARM64 desktop
 Build / Sign / ADB         Debian / Xfce4 / GPU
```

- **ADT** (this repository) is the *development-toolchain* layer: native SDK build-tools, platform-tools, signing and ADB workflows for Linux ARM64.
- **[Ternux](https://github.com/soobujmiah/ternux)** is the *Linux desktop* layer: a no-root Debian + Xfce4 desktop on Android via PRoot and Termux:X11, with GPU acceleration (Mesa/Zink, Turnip on Adreno). Site: [soobujmiah.github.io/ternux](https://soobujmiah.github.io/ternux/).

**How they relate.** Both run on the same foundation — Termux + PRoot Debian on an ARM64 phone — and ADT's canonical validation environment is exactly that foundation. Ternux gives you the desktop; ADT gives you the Android tooling inside it.

The full relationship — the two layers side by side, where they differ, what is verified between them and what is still not yet tested — is documented in **[docs/TERNUX_RELATIONSHIP.md](docs/TERNUX_RELATIONSHIP.md)**.

**What is verified vs experimental.** ADT's pipeline is verified on the shared PRoot Debian host (see Evidence above). Ternux's desktop and GPU stack are verified separately in the Ternux repository. Direct cross-project workflows (for example, running ADT-installed tools from inside a Ternux desktop session on the same device) are **observed to coexist** in this setup but are **not yet tested as a formal combined workflow** — they remain experimental until recorded as such.

## Limitations (the honesty boundary)

- The full chain up to signed, installed, executing native APKs is physically validated on one device family (Redmi Turbo 4 Pro PRoot Debian). On any other host the scripts are identical, but *"should work" is not "verified"* — treat `./setup.sh doctor` output as your first evidence check.
- The bundled x86_64 NDK host compiler does not execute under PRoot (no x86_64 ELF loader). ADT ships shims instead; Android-targeted native compilation in Termux uses Termux Clang with an Android target triple. Details: [`docs/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md`](docs/TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md#ndk--proot-reality).
- `build-tools 36.0.0/37.0.0` are built from the AOSP `platform-tools-35.0.2` tag — AOSP has no newer platform-tools tag. This is documented per version in `versions.json`, not hidden.
- Network is required for `cmdline-tools` and `platforms;android-*`; build-tools/platform-tools artifacts install fully offline.

## Project lineage

The build system adapts [lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools](https://github.com/lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools) (Android/Bionic via NDK) to native Linux ARM64/glibc. The Linux/glibc adaptation lineage, including earlier entries verified on Fedora Asahi 43, comes from `hamza72x/android-sdk-linux-arm64`; ADT (`soobujmiah/adt`) continues that work with on-device Termux/PRoot validation, checked-in offline artifacts, and self-hosted release plumbing. All release downloads and source-build clones resolve to this repository.

## Project boundary

ADT is the canonical project for this ARM64 Android development-tooling work. Higher-level projects may consume ADT's resulting capabilities, but ADT remains responsible for the underlying tooling. When a tool or version is added, the sequence is: `identify → obtain official source → adapt for Linux ARM64 → build → validate → document → record version status → publish reusable artifact when worthwhile`. Nothing is marked verified without evidence.
